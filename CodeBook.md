## Transformations applied to the data sets

All values were pulled from the original dataset files. Most column names,
except for setname, subjectid, and activity, were pulled from features.txt.
Data for the various features was pulled from train/X\_train.txt and
test/X\_test.txt. Only the columns that specifically mentioned "mean" or "std"
were kept. All others were dropped. The "setname" column was set to "test" or
"train" for rows based on the files from which they were pulled. The subjectid
variable was set based on values from the test/subject\_test.txt and
train/subject\_train.txt files. The activity column was set based on the
test/y\_test.txt and train/y\_train.txt, and labeled based on the information
in the activity\_labels.txt file.

Column names were reformatted to be more descriptive and to replace some
unwanted characters.

Finally, variables were averaged across subject/activity pairs to create the
final 180 observations.
